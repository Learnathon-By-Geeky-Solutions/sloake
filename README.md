## Project Description

# 📺 Streaming Platform

## 📝 Overview

Develop a **Streaming Platform** using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) where users can watch live streams, discover content, and interact with creators and other viewers. The platform will allow users to create accounts, subscribe to channels, upload and watch videos, engage in live chats and more. Creators can manage content, users, and monetize the platform.
